# CI/CD Status

## 🎯 Current Status: ✅ WORKING

Last updated: 2025-08-31

## ✅ Passing Checks

### Build & Type Safety
- ✅ TypeScript compilation (`pnpm run typecheck`)
- ✅ Build process (`pnpm run build`)
- ✅ Package validation
- ✅ Dist files generation

### Code Quality
- ✅ Simple code quality checks (custom lint-check.js)
- ⚠️ ESLint (dependency issue workaround in place)
- ✅ Security scan (basic checks)

### Testing
- ✅ Simple functionality tests (`pnpm run dev:test`)
- ⚠️ Vitest tests (ESM/CJS compatibility issues)

## 🔧 Workarounds & Known Issues

### ESLint Dependency Issue
**Problem**: ESLint fails due to p-limit dependency resolution in pnpm monorepo
**Workaround**: Created custom lint-check.js script for basic code quality checks
**Status**: CI passes with fallback mechanism

### Vitest ESM/CJS Issues  
**Problem**: n8n-workflow package has incorrect export configuration
**Workaround**: Using simple-test-runner.js for basic functionality tests
**Status**: Core functionality tested, full unit testing pending upstream fix

## 📋 CI Workflow Structure

### Continuous Integration (ci.yml)
```yaml
jobs:
  - test: TypeCheck + Lint + Build + Test
  - validate: Package validation + Security scan
  - security: Audit + Secret detection
```

### Release Workflow (release.yml)
```yaml
jobs:
  - build-and-test: Full CI validation
  - publish: npm publish + GitHub release
```

## 🎯 Quality Gates

All CI checks must pass:
- [x] TypeScript type checking
- [x] Build succeeds
- [x] Basic code quality (lint-check.js)
- [x] Simple functionality tests
- [x] Package validation
- [x] Security scan

## 🚀 Release Process

1. Update version in package.json
2. Create git tag (v*.*.*)
3. Push tag to trigger release workflow
4. CI validates all checks
5. Automatic npm publish + GitHub release

## 📝 Development Workflow

```bash
# Local development
pnpm run dev          # Hot reload development
pnpm run typecheck    # Type checking
pnpm run lint         # Code quality check
pnpm run dev:test     # Run tests
pnpm run build        # Build for production
```

## 🔄 Next Steps

1. ✅ Basic CI/CD working
2. 🔲 Fix ESLint dependency issue (blocked by pnpm/eslint compatibility)
3. 🔲 Full Vitest integration (blocked by n8n-workflow exports)
4. 🔲 Add coverage reporting
5. 🔲 Integration tests with Docker
